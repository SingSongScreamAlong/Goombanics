GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Breakable Prop Rules (WRITE-ONLY)

Blueprint Stub
- BP_BreakableProp (derived from ABreakableActor)

Mesh Assignment Rules
- Use StaticMeshComponent as the intact visual.
- Optional: BrokenMesh for replacement.
- If no BrokenMesh is provided, hide/disable collision on break.

DestructionValue Ranges (Guidelines)
- Small props (mailbox, bench, street sign): 10–40
- Medium props (parked car, kiosk, vending machine): 50–200
- Large props (small storefront awning, concrete barrier cluster): 250–600

Visual Replacement Strategy
- Phase 1: mesh swap or hide (logical only).
- Optional: spawn simple particle/dust FX (deferred).

Chaos Replacement (DEFERRED)
- TODO(Phase2-Windows): Create Geometry Collection variants for select hero breakables.
- Do NOT convert all breakables to Chaos.

Scoring / Match Flow
- Break() should call into GameState once (idempotent).

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Create BP_BreakableProp asset in /Content/Environment/Breakables/.
- Set default DestructionValue by size category.
