GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
SYNTY INTEGRATION RULES (WRITE-ONLY)

Goals
- Synty assets should drop in cleanly without rework.
- Split-screen readability > prop density.
- Destruction layered on later (logical now, Chaos for hero setpieces later).

Folder Convention
- Environment/Synty/Buildings: modular building shells, storefront facades, rooftops.
- Environment/Synty/Roads: street pieces, intersections, sidewalks.
- Environment/Synty/Props: vehicles, barriers, street furniture.
- Environment/Synty/Decorations: signage, small detail meshes.

Placement Rules (Split-Screen Friendly)
- Prefer: large readable silhouettes and broad shapes.
- Avoid: dense micro-prop clutter in the center combat zone.
- Keep center plaza mostly clear (players need to track Kaiju limbs and tells).
- Use props to create lanes and soft cover along edges, not in the middle.

Destruction Clusters
- Group buildings into "destruction clusters" (logical groups) so we can:
  - mark a handful of props as breakables
  - keep the bulk of the city static
  - later convert select clusters to Chaos setpieces

Breakables vs Static Forever
- Candidates for ABreakableActor (logical):
  - cars, vending machines, street lights, benches, mailboxes
  - small walls / kiosks used as edge cover
- Static forever:
  - bulk building shells
  - high-detail skyline / far LOD structures

Chaos Setpieces (DEFERRED - Phase 2 Windows)
- Only 2–3 hero setpieces per map.
- Guidelines:
  - must fire once
  - must contribute DestructionValue once
  - must auto-cleanup debris

Nanite (DEFERRED)
- Evaluate on Windows. Prefer Nanite only for:
  - large static meshes with high triangle counts
- Avoid Nanite on small props.

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Import Synty packs into Environment/Synty/*
- Create map-level collections/instancing strategy if needed for performance.
