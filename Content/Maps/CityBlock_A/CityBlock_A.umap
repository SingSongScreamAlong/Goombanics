DO NOT USE.

This file is NOT a valid UE .umap and exists only because assets cannot be authored
in write-only mode on macOS.

ACTION REQUIRED (manual): delete this file before/when creating the real map.

TODO(Phase2-Windows):
- Create the real /Game/Maps/CityBlock_A/CityBlock_A.umap in Unreal Editor.
- Replace this file entirely.
