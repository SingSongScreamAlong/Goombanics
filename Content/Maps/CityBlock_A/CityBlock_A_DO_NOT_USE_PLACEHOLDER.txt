DO NOT USE THIS AS A MAP.

GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
CityBlock_A placeholder marker (WRITE-ONLY on macOS)

A real UE5 .umap is a binary asset and must be created in Unreal Editor.

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Create /Game/Maps/CityBlock_A/CityBlock_A.umap in-editor.
- Build the arena following CityBlock_A_BuildNotes.txt.
- Set GameDefaultMap/EditorStartupMap back to /Game/Maps/CityBlock_A once the real map exists.
