GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
CityBlock_A - Kaiju Arena Design Notes (WRITE-ONLY)

High-level Intent
- A compact "city block" arena where the Kaiju is always within visual context.
- Players can flank and reposition without losing the Kaiju due to camera occlusion.

Kaiju Spawn
- Primary spawn point: Center Plaza
- Spawn orientation: facing down the longest sightline.
- Spawn clearance: keep a ~12m radius clear of dense props to avoid early physics/overlap issues.

Player Respawn Zones
- 4 respawn zones near the corners of the arena footprint.
- Each zone should have:
  - 2–3 PlayerStarts
  - immediate cover (low walls/planters)
  - a clear lane to the center within 2 seconds of sprinting
- Avoid respawns that face directly into Kaiju stomp range.

Weak Point Interaction Distances (Readability)
- Leg weak points should be targetable at 8–25m.
- Head weak point should be targetable at 15–40m during stagger.
- Keep overhead obstruction minimal so players can look up without camera clipping.

Stagger Windows Communication
- In-world readability first:
  - Kaiju posture change and/or VFX pulses
  - a distinct audio sting
- HUD assistance:
  - stagger indicator + head weakpoint highlight

No AI tuning in this phase.

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Place KaijuSpawn tagged actor in CityBlock_A.umap.
- Place volume-based safe spawn zones and test with 4-way split.
- Add simple in-world cues for stagger window (lightweight VFX).
