GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Map: CityBlock_A
Engine: UE 5.5.x
Mode: WRITE-ONLY authoring notes (map will be created/edited in Unreal Editor on Windows Phase 2)

GOAL
- A readable, split-screen-friendly city block arena for 1–4 players.
- Central Kaiju combat zone with clear sightlines.
- Hard edges to keep players in the arena (physical + visual).
- Verticality that does NOT break cameras.

INTENDED SCALE (UE units)
- Unreal default scale: 1uu = 1cm.
- Arena target footprint: ~120m x 120m (12,000uu x 12,000uu).
- Primary combat square: ~60m x 60m.
- Streets: 10–12m wide.
- Sidewalks: 2–4m.
- Building heights: 1–4 stories (avoid tall canyons that occlude cameras).

SPATIAL LAYOUT (TOP-DOWN)
- Central plaza/intersection = Kaiju primary engagement area.
- 4 streets form a cross around the center.
- Corner lots: 4 modular building shells that create boundaries.
- Perimeter “soft funnel” props (parked cars, jersey barriers) to guide movement without clutter.

ARENA EDGES / PLAYER CONTAINMENT
- Use a combination of:
  - Low walls (1–1.5m)
  - Collidable planters
  - Fence lines
  - Gently sloped berms
- Avoid invisible walls unless necessary.

SPLIT-SCREEN SIGHTLINES
- Keep the center readable from any street approach.
- Avoid dense prop clutter in the middle.
- Avoid tight indoor corridors (players should not need to enter buildings).

VERTICALITY RULES
- Preferred: ramps, stairs to small platforms (2–4m elevation).
- Avoid: multi-floor interior navigation.
- Kaiju should remain visible from most play space.

SPAWNS
- Kaiju spawn: center plaza, slightly offset to avoid immediate player spawn overlap.
- Player spawns: 4 corner-adjacent zones, each with 2–3 PlayerStarts for variety.

BREAKABLES / DESTRUCTION
- Scatter breakables in clusters near edges and along streets.
- Keep center mostly clear to reduce chaos noise for split-screen.

CHAOS SETPIECES (DEFERRED)
- Reserve 2–3 hero setpiece locations (Phase 2 Windows):
  - Storefront wall facing the plaza
  - Crane/gantry near one corner lot
  - Parking garage corner chunk

LIGHTING (DEFERRED)
- Phase 2: choose either fully dynamic or baked; prioritize performance for 4-player split.

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Create CityBlock_A.umap in Unreal Editor.
- Place: PlayerStarts, KaijuSpawn actor/tag, breakables, setpiece markers.
- Verify: camera readability, split-screen performance, navmesh for Kaiju.
