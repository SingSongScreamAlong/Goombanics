GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
WEAPON FEEL NOTES (WRITE-ONLY)

Core Pillars
- Powerful: players feel impact even without Chaos.
- Silly: ragdoll launches, exaggerated impulses.
- Readable: clear feedback layers for split-screen.

Rifle Intent
- "Constant pressure" tool.
- Always feels usable.
- Hit feedback is frequent but subtle.
- Primary role: Kaiju DPS and weak point chip.

Rocket Launcher Intent
- "Comedy chaos" tool.
- Slower cadence, huge payoff.
- Environmental bias: encourages collateral + crowd-clearing.
- Primary role: stagger setup moments and cinematic knockback.

Tuning Philosophy
- Use data assets so feel can be tuned live on Windows Phase 2.
- Keep weapon logic modular so online scaling doesn’t require a rewrite.

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Create DA_WeaponTuning and iterate values in PIE.
- Add camera shake assets and audio events per weapon.
- Add optional per-weapon hit marker style.
