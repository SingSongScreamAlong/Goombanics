2. COMPILE-BLOCKING BUGS (must fix before Windows build)
================================================================================

BUG #1: ENUM NAME MISMATCH (COMPILE BLOCKER) -- FIXED
  File: Source/Goombanics/Weapons/GoombanicsWeaponComponent.cpp, lines 23, 33, 161
  Issue: Used "EWeaponFireMode" but enum is declared as "EGoombanicsFireMode".
  Status: FIXED in this audit pass.

BUG #2: LEADING WHITESPACE IN Build.cs -- FIXED
  File: Source/Goombanics/Goombanics.Build.cs, line 4
  Issue: " using System.IO;" had a leading space.
  Status: FIXED in this audit pass.

BUG #3: LEADING WHITESPACE IN GameState.cpp -- FIXED
  File: Source/Goombanics/Core/GoombanicsGameState.cpp, line 7
  Issue: " #include" had a leading space.
  Status: FIXED in this audit pass.

BUG #4: DEPRECATED ENUM STILL PRESENT (non-blocking)
  File: Source/Goombanics/Core/GoombanicsTypes.h, lines 39-46
  Issue: EGoombanicsPlayerRole is marked deprecated but still used by
         PlayerState deprecated wrappers. Not a blocker but adds dead weight.
  Risk: Low. Deprecated wrappers are functional. Can remove in Phase 2.

BUG #5: PLACEHOLDER .umap FILE (manual action required)
  File: Content/Maps/CityBlock_A/CityBlock_A.umap
  Issue: This was written as a text placeholder, not a valid binary .umap.
         UE editor will fail to load it.
  Fix: Delete this file manually on Windows before opening the project.
  Note: CityBlock_A_DO_NOT_USE_PLACEHOLDER.txt already documents this.
