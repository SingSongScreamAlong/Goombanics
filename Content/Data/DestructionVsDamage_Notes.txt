GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
DESTRUCTION vs KAIJU DAMAGE (DESIGN NOTES - WRITE-ONLY)

Two parallel goals exist in every match:
1) Kill the Kaiju (direct combat damage)
2) Survive/limit city destruction (or embrace chaos for score, depending on mode)

Player Choice Tension
- Players constantly choose:
  - Focus fire weak points to stagger and finish
  - Cause chaos to score collateral / create space

Weapon Bias
- Rifle:
  - Bias toward Kaiju DPS
  - Weak point chip damage
  - Low collateral impact
- Rocket Launcher:
  - Bias toward collateral/destruction
  - Knockback/comedy
  - Can still help Kaiju via stagger setup and head window bursts

Scoring Multipliers (Deferred)
- TODO(Phase2-Windows): Add score multipliers for:
  - Weak point destruction during stagger
  - Collateral chains (multi-break within a short window)
  - Risk proximity bonus (close-range leg shots)

Chaos (Deferred)
- Chaos setpieces contribute DestructionValue once; the spectacle should not dominate readability.
