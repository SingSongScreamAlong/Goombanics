GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
WINDOWS_PHASE2_TODO (WRITE-ONLY)

Prereqs
- Install Unreal Engine 5.5.x on Windows.
- Ensure Visual Studio toolchain + UE prerequisites are installed.

Build / Open Project
- Open Goombanics.uproject in UE 5.5.x.
- Generate project files if prompted.
- Build C++ modules.
- Resolve any include path / module dependency issues.

Validate Core Loop (1–4 local split-screen)
- Validate 1 player:
  - Start match, time/death/destruction values update.
  - HUD binds correctly to GameState/PlayerState getters.
- Validate 2–4 local players:
  - Correct viewport layout.
  - Correct per-player HUD instances.
  - Scoreboard includes all locals.
  - Respawn flow works per controller.

Content Minimums (v1 playable)
- Add 1 Kaiju pawn (skeletal mesh placeholder ok) with:
  - Health + weak point visualization.
  - Stagger state visualization.
- Add 2 weapons (minimum):
  - Rifle
  - Rocket launcher

Chaos Destruction (2–3 setpieces)
- Add 2–3 authored Chaos setpieces (NOT everywhere):
  - Street facade collapse
  - Fuel station / tank explosion
  - Parking garage section break
- Ensure setpieces feed into the destruction meter / scoring.

Performance Profiling Checklist
- Run stat passes in representative scenarios:
  - 4-way split-screen with Kaiju + explosions + UI
- Watch:
  - Game thread time
  - Render thread time
  - GPU time
  - Hitches / spikes (streaming, physics)
- Validate scalability toggles:
  - Niagara/VFX density
  - shadow quality
  - view distance
  - physics sub-stepping (if used)

Networking Spot-Checks (early)
- Ensure authority boundaries are respected:
  - Server-only match end
  - Server-only possession decisions
- Confirm replicated state reaches clients:
  - match phase/time/destruction
  - Kaiju health/weak points
  - PlayerState stats

Known Risks / Watch List
- Split-screen HUD readability and safe-zone issues.
- Possession swap edge cases (HUD refresh, stale pawn pointers, ability gating).
- Chaos performance spikes and replication overhead.
- Large physics objects causing unstable simulation.
- Breakable reset between rounds (map reset/reload strategy).
- Asset streaming hitches in 4-player scenarios.
