GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
RAGDOLL + DEATH PHILOSOPHY (DESIGN NOTES - WRITE-ONLY)

Core Philosophy
- Death is expected.
- Death is funny.
- Death should not feel punishing.

Rules
- Time-to-respawn is short.
- Score penalties are minimal (or none).
- A death should be a story beat: players laugh and immediately re-engage.

Ragdoll Exaggeration
- Launch strength can be exaggerated beyond realism.
- Direction should be readable (away from explosion / Kaiju swipe).
- Avoid instant ragdoll spam; keep it tied to big events (rocket, stomp, sweep).

Post-death Camera
- Very short linger on the chaos (<= 0.5s) then respawn.
- Prefer cinematic moments only on:
  - Kaiju stomp multi-kill
  - Big rocket chain reaction

Chaos Hook (Deferred)
- TODO(Phase2-Windows): Use Chaos impulses on ragdoll bodies for comedy launches.
- TODO: Cap impulses / add sleep to prevent physics storms in 4-player split-screen.
