GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE_v1 (WRITE-ONLY)

Purpose
- Freeze the Phase 1 architecture assumptions so Phase 2 work (Windows build, Chaos, content authoring) happens without reshaping the foundation.

Core Invariants (MUST NOT BREAK)
1) Pawn owns gameplay state + rules for itself
- Health, weak points, stagger state, weapon ownership/attachment, and destruction interactions live on the Pawn/Actor that is being interacted with.
- Monster/Kaiju behavior must function the same whether possessed by AI or a player.

2) Controller owns input + decision making
- PlayerController: input mapping, camera/HUD ownership, and possession transitions.
- AIController: AI decision making.
- Controllers do not own authoritative gameplay state that must persist across possession swaps.

3) GameMode = rules (server-only)
- Match rules, authoritative spawning, authoritative possession decisions, and match end conditions.
- Never read GameMode directly from client UI.

4) GameState = replicated match state
- Match phase, time remaining, destruction percent, match end reason, end-of-round awards.
- Provide Blueprint-friendly getters for UI.

5) PlayerState = identity + score
- Player identity and replicated score/stat tracking.
- Role is a label for UI/scoring context; possession is the actual control state.

6) Kaiju is explicit and possession-based
- The Kaiju is a real pawn that exists in-world.
- Player-controlled Kaiju is implemented via possession of the Kaiju pawn.

Non-Goals for v1 (EXPLICIT)
- No ranked/competitive matchmaking.
- No advanced anti-cheat.
- No complex class/hero loadouts.
- No multi-round campaign meta-progression.
- No dynamic “mystery role” mechanics.
- No full-featured destruction simulation everywhere (Chaos used only for setpieces initially).

Frozen Now (DO NOT CHANGE IN PHASE 2)
- Responsibility boundaries above (Pawn/Controller/GameMode/GameState/PlayerState).
- Possession-driven Kaiju control model.
- Network authority model: server owns match flow and possession.
- UI binding approach: read replicated state from GameState/PlayerState and the currently possessed pawn.

Allowed to Change Later (FUTURE-FLEX)
- Exact weapon tuning values and score weights.
- Specific award types and thresholds.
- Match variants and their tuning DataAssets.
- UI layout/art, as long as data sources remain consistent.
- Whether Kaiju starts AI-controlled before a player takes over (variant-driven).

Phase 2 Integration Reminder
- Create DataAssets in Content and wire them into GameMode/GameState on Windows.
- Validate split-screen and replication before adding more complexity.
