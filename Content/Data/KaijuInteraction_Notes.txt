GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
KAIJU ↔ PLAYER INTERACTION (DESIGN NOTES - WRITE-ONLY)

Player Perception Goals
- Massive: everything about the Kaiju implies scale.
- Unfair at first: first contact is scary and disorienting.
- Beat-able through coordination: players learn patterns through failure.

Weak Points
- Legs:
  - Commitment and risk (close range)
  - Destroy both legs to earn stagger
- Head:
  - Reward window (stagger-only bonus damage)

Telegraphing (Readability)
- Every Kaiju attack should have:
  - A clear wind-up pose
  - An audio cue
  - A predictable impact zone
- Players should be able to learn timing even while dying.

Stagger Readability
- Must be unmissable:
  - posture collapse + dust burst
  - distinct sound
  - HUD indicator

Deferred (Phase2-Windows)
- Animation tuning, montage timing, VFX, audio.
- Ensure stagger windows feel generous but earned.
