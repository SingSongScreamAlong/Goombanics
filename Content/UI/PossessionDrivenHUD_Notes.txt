GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
POSSESSION-DRIVEN HUD NOTES (WRITE-ONLY)

Goal
- UI must adapt based on what the local PlayerController is currently possessing.
- Kaiju control is explicit: if you are possessing the Kaiju, your UI should look and feel Kaiju.

Core Rule
- HUD is driven by (OwningPlayerController -> GetPawn()) and/or a small interface on the possessed pawn.

Recommended Pattern (Phase2-Windows)
- Define a lightweight BlueprintNativeEvent interface (or C++ base class API) on pawns:
  - GetGoombanicsHUDMode() -> Human / Kaiju / Spectator
  - GetGoombanicsHUDData() -> struct with the common fields needed by widgets
- When possession changes:
  - APlayerController::OnPossess / OnUnPossess triggers HUD refresh.
  - HUD swaps or reconfigures widgets.

Split-Screen
- Each local player gets their own HUD instance.
- Each HUD instance binds to its owning controller + currently possessed pawn.

Suggested UI Differences
- Human-controlled pawn:
  - Weapon/ammo block
  - Crosshair + hit marker
  - Personal score + team context
- Kaiju-controlled pawn:
  - Weak point state emphasis
  - Stomp/roar cooldowns (future)
  - Collateral focus meters (optional)
- Spectator:
  - Minimal scoreboard + freecam info

Networking Notes
- Server is authoritative for possession.
- Clients should rely on replicated possession state (PlayerController->Pawn) and replicated GameState values.

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Implement possession-driven HUD refresh events.
- Add a Kaiju-specific HUD layout (even if minimal at first).
- Validate 1–4 local players with mid-match possession swaps.
