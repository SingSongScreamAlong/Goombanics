GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
PLAYER FEEDBACK SYSTEM (DESIGN NOTES - WRITE-ONLY)

Goal
- Make every hit feel readable and satisfying in 1–4 player split-screen.
- Feedback must be layered so players understand:
  - Did I hit?
  - Did I hit the Kaiju vs the environment?
  - Did I hit a weak point?
  - Did that matter?

Hit Confirmation Layers
1) Hit Marker (UI)
- Small, high-contrast cross/shape at center.
- Different marker for:
  - Kaiju body
  - Kaiju weak point
  - Breakable/environment
- Duration: very short (<= 120ms) so it doesn’t clutter.

2) Damage Numbers (UI)
- Optional, minimal. Prefer “burst” numbers only on:
  - Weak point hits
  - Final blow
  - Stagger window head bonus
- Keep font large enough for split-screen.

3) Audio Intent
- Distinct layers:
  - Kaiju flesh/armor impact
  - Weak point critical ping (higher pitch)
  - Breakable crunch / shatter
  - Rocket explosion: comedic + bassy
- Avoid overwhelming mix; prioritize Kaiju telegraph audio.

4) Camera Feedback
- Weapon recoil:
  - Rifle: subtle per-shot kick
  - Rocket: slow heavy kick + big shake
- Kaiju stagger:
  - larger shake / rumble for all players (but very brief)

5) Screen Feedback
- Micro color flash on weak point hit (short, readable).
- On stagger: brief vignette or desat pulse (optional).

Deferred (Phase2-Windows)
- Implement actual UMG widgets + animations.
- Add camera shakes, audio cues, and controller rumble.
- Tune for readability via PIE split-screen.
