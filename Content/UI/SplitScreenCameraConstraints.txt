GOOMBANICS: COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Split-Screen Camera Constraints (WRITE-ONLY)

Design Priorities
- Readability > spectacle.
- Maintain consistent camera behavior across 1–4 players.

Camera Distance & Height (Target Ranges)
- Third-person follow camera distance: ~350–500uu (3.5–5m)
- Camera boom height: ~60–90uu

FOV
- Single player: 80–90 degrees
- 2–4 players: 90–100 degrees if needed for situational awareness

Vertical Obstruction Rules
- Avoid overhead beams/awnings that cause frequent camera collision.
- Avoid narrow alleys that force constant camera zoom-in.
- Keep gameplay-critical areas outdoors and open.

Level Layout Constraints
- No tight indoor corridors.
- Avoid tall building canyons in the central combat zone.
- Keep the Kaiju visible from at least 2–3 major positions per quadrant.

HUD Readability
- Minimize small text.
- Use icons, bars, and color coding.

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Validate with 4-player split: camera collision, FOV, occlusion.
- Apply per-local-player UI scaling rules if needed.
