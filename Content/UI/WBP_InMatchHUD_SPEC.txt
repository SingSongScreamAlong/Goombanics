WBP_InMatchHUD (SPEC - create in Unreal Editor on Windows Phase 2)

Asset Path
- /Game/UI/WBP_InMatchHUD

Parent Class (recommended)
- UGoombanicsHUDWidget (existing C++ widget) OR a new UUserWidget with bindings to GameState/PlayerState getters.

Primary Design Goal
- Split-screen readability (1–4 players): compact, high contrast, big numbers.

Required Bindings (Data Sources)
- GameState (AGoombanicsGameState)
  - MatchPhase
  - TimeRemaining
  - DestructionPercent
  - bTotalledAchieved
  - KaijuHealthPercent
  - WeakPointStates (LeftLeg/RightLeg/Head)
  - GetSortedScoreboard(MaxEntries, bIncludeAllLocals)
- PlayerState (AGoombanicsPlayerState)
  - TotalScore
  - KaijuDamageDealt
  - CollateralDamageScore
  - WeakPointsDestroyed
  - Deaths
  - Role (Human/Kaiju)

Display Rules
- Timer: large, always visible.
- Destruction meter: bar + percent text.
- Kaiju health: bar + percent.
- Weak points: 3 compact bars (color shift when destroyed).
- Stagger indicator: large short-lived banner.
- Scoreboard: Top-N list; always include local players even if not top.

Layout Guidance
- Keep HUD within safe zones for split-screen.
- Avoid small labels; prefer icons + large numerics.
- Use short text strings (e.g., "KAIJU", "CITY", "TIME").

TODO(Phase2-Windows)
- Bind to GameState delegates for reactive updates.
- Add simple hit marker + weak-point indicator overlays.
